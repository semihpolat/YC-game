# Statue [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/statue-ssg.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/statue-ssg) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Statue is a blazingly-fast static site generator based on Markdown, Sveltekit, and a component library. Setup:

```bash
yes | npx sv create . --template minimal --types ts --no-add-ons --install npm && npm install statue-ssg && npx statue init && npm install && npm run dev
```

Content like blogs and documentation can be added and modified directly through `.md` files, with pages and the site structure itself based on Svelte components. Statue sites are fully static, so **management is simple, development can be non-technical, and hosting is cheap or free. [Join us on Discord! 🗿](https://discord.gg/accretional)**

## Why Statue?
Above all else, Statue is **Fast, Simple, and Flexible from start to finish**. It takes only one command to get started, builds and deployments are fast, hosting is simple, sites are extensible, and developing a Statue site is about building what you want rather than battling, learning, and conforming to the tool itself.

- **Markdown-first**: Build out your site content by writing `.md` files: no coding required.
- **Powered by SvelteKit**: Familiar Svelte features and ecosystem, based on an elegant declarative model ideal for static sites.
- **Tailwind + Components**: Customize the UI easily with Tailwind CSS, and a library of included components.
- **Easy to Use and Extend**: The Declarative Component Model is easy to use, and with LLMs, easy for even non-technical users to work with.
- **Ultra-cheap hosting**: Deploy static output to Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, etc.
- **Low Maintenance**: Static sites are almost maintenance-free, and Statue itself is much less complex than other web tools.

Statue meets the needs of multiple kinds of use cases and users. Even non-developers can write markdown files and use AI to build and customize Statue sites. Statue's design is intentionally highly structured, self-contained, and based on simple-yet-familiar web technologies, so that LLMs could productively contribute to it even when guided by non-technical users. That same commitment to order and constrained complexity makes it great for developers, too: they can spend less time on the tool itself, and more time building.

Statue exists to help you create static sites, according to your needs and vision. It's a tool that does what you ask of it, and no more. Setting up a website shouldn't be any harder than this:

```bash
yes | npx sv create . --template minimal --types ts --no-add-ons --install npm && npm install statue-ssg && npx statue init && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Setup

### Recommended: Quickstart
This single command creates a SvelteKit project, installs Statue SSG, and initializes it. Just copy and paste it in your terminal.

```bash
yes | npx sv create . --template minimal --types ts --no-add-ons --install npm && npm install statue-ssg && npx statue init && npm install && npm run dev
```

If you'd like to start with a project with different defaults, or some of the required dependencies (mostly just npm) are missing and causing that command to fail, here are some steps laid out more iteratively,

### 1) Create a SvelteKit project
```bash
npx sv create . --template minimal --types ts --no-add-ons --install npm

npm install
```

### 2) Install Statue SSG
```bash
npm install statue-ssg
```

### 3) Initialize Statue SSG
```bash
npx statue init
```

Or choose a specific template (e.g., `blog`):
```bash
npx statue init --template blog
```

### 4) Start the dev server
```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Creating Content
Add Markdown files under the `content` directory. The folder structure maps to URLs.

```
content/
├─ blog/              # Blog posts → /blog/...
│  └─ hello-world.md  # e.g. /blog/hello-world
├─ docs/              # Documentation → /docs/...
│  └─ getting-started.md
└─ legal/             # Legal pages → /legal/...
```

### Markdown example
```markdown
---
title: My First Post
description: Short description
date: 2025-04-03

# Hello

This page was statically generated by Statue SSG.
```
## How to edit/create pages with AI tools

Go to the `src/routes/` folder in your project.  
Inside, you’ll find a file named `+page.svelte` — this is your **homepage**.  
You can edit this file using any AI tool you prefer.

If you want to create a **new page**, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder inside `src/routes/`.
2. Inside that folder, create a file named `+page.svelte`.
3. Ask your AI tool to generate or modify the content of this new `+page.svelte` file.

Or, write the page yourself: we recommend starting with an existing or minimal page if you do.

## Theme System (Brief)
Statue SSG ships with built-in themes. Import one in `src/lib/index.css`:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "statue-ssg/themes/blue.css"; /* or red.css, green.css, ... */

@source "../";
@source "../../node_modules/statue-ssg/src/**/*.{svelte,js,ts}";
```

To create a custom theme or see all available themes, see `src/lib/themes/README.md` in this repository.

## Svelte and Routes
Markdown files are turned into pages automatically. You can keep adding SvelteKit routes under `src/routes/` (pages, layouts, endpoints). UI components can be customized with Tailwind.

## Build and Preview
Generate the static site and preview it locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The static output is written to the `build/` directory. Deploy that directory directly to your static hosting provider.

## How to Deploy Your Website

If you're done editing your site, it's time to publish it.  
One of the biggest advantages of being fully static is **free hosting up to very high traffic levels (200,000+ users)**.  
You can deploy anywhere — **Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, GitHub Pages**, etc.

In this guide, we'll use **Cloudflare Pages**.

---

### Pre-Setup

Run the following command in your terminal to install Wrangler and log in to Cloudflare:

```bash
npm install wrangler && wrangler login
```
This connects your local environment to your Cloudflare account.
### Deploy
Paste this single command into your terminal.
When it finishes, click the link it prints — your site is now live!

```bash
npm run build && npx wrangler pages deploy build --project-name=myfirstwebsite
```
You can optionally connect a custom domain later from the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure `--ignore-scripts` is not enabled in your npm configuration; otherwise initialization may not run.

## Developer Notes
- `npx statue init` sets up the project files and configuration.
- During `npm run build`, `hooks/server.js` discovers root routes and generates static pages.
- Rendering uses SvelteKit defaults (`+page.svelte`, `+page.server.js`).

## Updating the Project
- Bump the version in `package.json`.
- Commit your changes.
- Run `npm run release` to publish.

## Local Testing
- Run `npm pack` to produce a local package tarball.
- Install it into a test project: `npm install <path-to-generated-tgz>`.
